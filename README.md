# Moriya Universalis 4
Moriya Universalis 4 is a mod for the grand strategy game Europa Universalis 4. The mod will detail the history (and future?) of the [Moriya Shrine](https://www.moriyashrine.org) community through EU4, alongside its various splits (such as the Shining Needle Castle).

## Current Roadmap
Currently we are working on the basics of the mod, such as countries and national ideas. There is no timetable for release, and there won't be one for a while.
