# Moriya Universalis 4
Moriya Universalis 4 is a mod for the grand strategy game Europa Universalis 4. The mod will detail the history (and future?) of the [Moriya Shrine](https://www.moriyashrine.org) community through EU4, alongside its various splits (such as the Shining Needle Castle).

## Current Roadmap
![Soon](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/631070457965182996/632362415824306179/Screenshot_2019-09-15_at_2.52.28_PM.png)

## The Goal
The goal of the mod is to transform EU4 to a game in which you can take control of a denizen/member nation (such as Sci's *Empire of Hugs*, Pebbles' *Gran Pebbellia*, or Arche's *Archeland*) and play as their nations, while also befriending or fighting other user nations. I wanna add achievements too.
